### üìå CLAUSE EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW

**Confidentiality Clause**:
> Both Parties agree to maintain strict confidentiality of all proprietary, technical, or business information disclosed. Neither Party shall disclose such information to third parties without prior written consent.

**Indemnity Clause**:
> The [Client/Employee] shall indemnify and hold harmless the [Agency/Employer] from all losses arising due to breach, misrepresentation, or third-party claims arising from the performance of this agreement.

**Force Majeure**:
> Neither Party shall be liable for delay or failure to perform obligations due to events beyond their control including acts of God, pandemic, governmental orders, or natural calamities.

Termination:
> This agreement may be terminated by giving [30] days written notice after the lock-in period. Immediate termination may occur in case of breach or non-payment.

Non-Compete Clause:

---

### üß† ANALYSIS & COMPLIANCE

After drafting the agreement, provide a structured **Clause Risk Analysis**:

- Highlight risky, one-sided, or ambiguous phrases.
- Use bullet points to explain risks for each major clause.
- Suggest improvements for missing standard clauses.
- Use **bold** for clause names and **red text** to flag risky terms (like "indemnify", "terminate", "waive").

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Return output as:
--- CONTRACT TEXT ---
<full draft here with clauses>

--- RISK ANALYSIS ---
<bullet points>

Keep language jurisdiction-appropriate (e.g., Indian law: Arbitration & Conciliation Act, Companies Act 2013, etc.)

Avoid vague placeholders like [insert here]. Fill all with default legal language when blank.
